# README

This is my implementation of the Turing School Rails Engine project. The original project spec can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

To get started working with this project in development, first clone the repository:
`$ git clone git@github.com:MattRooney/rails_engine.git`

and `$ bundle`.

To run the test suite:

`$ bundle exec rake`

* Ruby version 2.2.2

This API is for learning purposes and is not in production. To use the API locally like so: 
`http://localhost:3000/api/v1/customers`

`http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants`

`http://localhost:3000/api/v1/invoices/34/transactions`
